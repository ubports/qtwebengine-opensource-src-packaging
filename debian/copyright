Comment:
 The code states:
 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 .
 [...]
 .
 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
  - Ian Jackson <ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu>.
 Still in the public domain.
 .
 Josh Coalson: made some changes to integrate with libFLAC.
 Still in the public domain.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Academic Free License v. 2.0
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
 authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
 following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
 Work:
 .
 Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.0
 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
 following:
 .
 a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
 b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
    Work;
 c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
    public;
 d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 .
 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
 claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
 Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
 Original Work and Derivative Works.
 .
 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
 form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
 documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
 agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
 Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
 Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
 machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
 reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
 long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
 the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
 the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
 .
 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
 of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
 service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
 Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
 in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
 patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
 expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
 offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
 defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
 such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
 interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
 License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
 license.
 .
 5) This section intentionally omitted.
 .
 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
 Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
 Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
 descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
 the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
 Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
 modified the Original Work.
 .
 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
 the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
 by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
 of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
 and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
 sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
 and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
 the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
 This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
 license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
 .
 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
 Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
 or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
 or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
 of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
 apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
 negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
 jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
 consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
 .
 9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
 a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
 obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
 else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
 grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
 or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
 to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
 between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
 equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
 exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
 Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
 .
 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
 and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
 as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
 for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent
 applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent
 applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original
 Work with other software or hardware).
 .
 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
 License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
 Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
 the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
 Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
 scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
 requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101 et seq.,
 the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section
 shall survive the termination of this License.
 .
 12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
 seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
 recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
 attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
 any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
 License.
 .
 13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
 the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
 make it enforceable.
 .
 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
 in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
 under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
 entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
 under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
 (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
 entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
 (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
 entity.
 .
 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
 restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
 to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

 1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other
 work which Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available and
 which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or
 work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of

 the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter
 acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject
 matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent
 necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code

 anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as
 part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but
 not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication
 with a client other than You.
 .
 1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions
 thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.
 .
 1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change
 to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous
 Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous
 Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is

 and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program
 statements that contains any part of Covered Code.
 .
 1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other
 work as originally made available by Apple under this License,
 including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs
 or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been
 expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such
 work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and
 originally made available by Apple under this License.
 .
 1.8 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other
 work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all
 modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
 scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable

 1.9 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
 rights under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your"
 includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under

 .
 2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms
 and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on
 the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a
 world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of
 Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original
 Code, to do the following:
 .
 2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform,
 internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy
 verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or
 non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:
 .
 (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
 copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as
 they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
 Original Code that refer to this License; and
 .
 (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source
 Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally
 Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code
 that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights
 hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.
 .
 2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce,
 display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and
 Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial
 or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also
 meet all of these conditions:
 .
 (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to
 the Source Code of the Covered Code;
 .
 (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the
 notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
 Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
 (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make
 Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either
 available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your
 Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally
 Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in
 this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3
 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve
 (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is
 longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your
 Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a
 web site).
 .
 2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You
 Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in
 object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent
 notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
 stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the
 terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such
 Source Code.
 .
 2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
 although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their
 respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no
 assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered
 Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
 rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any
 liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
 condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You
 hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
 property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
 license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
 Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
 Covered Code.
 .
 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
 licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any
 person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this
 License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license,
 under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property
 rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use,
 reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
 Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as
 Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
 .
 4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
 Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
 distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance,
 You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
 the Covered Code or any portion thereof.
 .
 5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in
 Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by
 Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional
 patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole
 discretion.
 .
 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other
 rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
 ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
 responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You
 must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms
 are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend
 and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by
 reason of any such Additional Terms.
 .
 7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new
 versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given
 a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published
 under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it
 under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
 Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this
 License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to
 modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
 License.
 .
 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
 part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
 Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and
 may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge
 and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at
 Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
 WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND
 APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
 ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
 MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
 PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
 INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE
 FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
 THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
 ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO
 ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE
 AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
 You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the
 operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
 systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of
 the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
 physical or environmental damage.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
 EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
 TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR
 ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
 TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
 APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
 REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all
 damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this
 License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
 .
 10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the
 trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac", "Mac OS",
 "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks,
 service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively
 "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name
 belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in
 or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or
 to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other
 than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times
 with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted
 at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
 .
 11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,
 each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
 Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights,
 title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications
 made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple
 Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple
 may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple
 Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
 contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.
 .
 12. Termination.
 .
 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
 terminate:
 .
 (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
 any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
 days of becoming aware of such breach;
 .
 (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
 13.5(b); or
 .
 (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during
 the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement
 against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence
 an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.
 .
 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately
 stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and
 distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
 which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive
 any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
 should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
 survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11,
 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,
 indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
 this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
 License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
 any party.
 .
 13. Miscellaneous.
 .
 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
 defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in
 the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the
 public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license
 in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR
 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for
 Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --
 Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer
 Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S.
 Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
 forth herein.
 .
 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as
 creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
 legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and
 You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
 implication, appearance or otherwise.
 .
 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair
 Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
 it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
 same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
 Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
 develop, produce, market or distribute.
 .
 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to
 enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of
 future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or
 regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
 construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.
 .
 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent
 jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
 to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to
 the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits
 and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will
 continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
 specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
 enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
 immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
 the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
 possession or control.
 .
 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution
 between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the
 Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to
 the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal
 courts within that District with respect to this License. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
 International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
 .
 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the
 entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
 matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
 United States and the State of California, except that body of
 California law concerning conflicts of law.
 .
 Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
 clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
 that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
 parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
 connexes soient rediges en anglais.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.
 .
  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.
 .
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 .
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
    o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
      (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
      to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
      accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
      unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
      source files.
 .
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.
 .
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.
 .
